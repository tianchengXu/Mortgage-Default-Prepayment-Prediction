# Predicting Mortgage Default and Prepayment via Cox Proportional Hazards Models (R)

Performed ETL on 3M+ data from mortgage loans, mortgage rates, national unemployment rates and House Price Indices; using survival package, trained multiple coxph models and determined the best choice of variables through cross-validation; predicted default/prepayment; visualized cumulative probabilities using ggplot2 to report the default/prepayment likelihood of a given loan.
