# Mortgage-Default-Prepayment-Prediction

I worked on 2 similar projects that predicts mortgage default and prepayment

# Project 1: Predicting Mortgage Default and Prepayment via Cox Proportional Hazards Models (R)

Performed ETL on 3M+ data from mortgage loans, mortgage rates, national unemployment rates and House Price Indices; using survival package, trained multiple coxph models and determined the best choice of variables through cross-validation; predicted default/prepayment; visualized cumulative probabilities using ggplot2 to report the default/prepayment likelihood of a given loan.

# Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis and Default/Prepayment Models for Unison (Python)

Using lifeline package in Python, trained multiple coxph models and compared the best choice of variables; applied k-fold cross-validation; predicted default/prepayment; visualized mortgage default/prepayment distribution with matplotlib.
